üåê 1. Website Template Conversion Ingestion Pipeline
1.1 Trigger Conversion
User submits a URL via frontend form.

Frontend (Next.js) sends a request to an API Gateway endpoint backed by Lambda (Python).

1.2 Conversion Environment Setup
Lambda invokes the React Component Generator, passing the URL.

A dedicated S3 bucket (e.g., conversion-temp-bucket) is used to store intermediate files.

1.3 Run Conversion Process
The generator:

Scrapes the URL and downloads the HTML/CSS/JS.

Converts pages to React components.

Outputs a folder with Next.js App Router-style structure.

üèó 2. Template Build and Integration Pipeline
2.1 Store Converted Code
The resulting folder is zipped and uploaded to S3 (e.g., template-code-store bucket).

Metadata (name, URL, timestamp, tags, preview path, etc.) is stored in DynamoDB.

2.2 Build Preview Site
A build job is triggered (via Step Functions, CodeBuild, or a Lambda).

The job:

Downloads the template folder from S3.

Merges it into the existing Next.js monorepo (e.g., under app/templates/<template-slug>).

Runs next build.

2.3 Deploy Preview
Uploads updated .next build output to a preview bucket (S3 + CloudFront).

Each template gets its own route under something like preview.example.com/templates/<template-slug>.

üè¨ 3. Template Storefront Management
3.1 Metadata Management
DynamoDB acts as the main metadata index.

Includes:

Template Name

Description

Slug/Route

Tags

Screenshot URLs (also uploaded to S3)

Status (published/draft)

Source URL

3.2 Admin Interface
Next.js admin panel to:

View uploaded templates

Approve/publish templates

Delete templates

Re-trigger builds

üöÄ 4. Public Website & Template Delivery
4.1 Public Storefront
Next.js (SSG or SSR) reads from DynamoDB.

Renders a store listing of all templates.

4.2 Live Preview via CloudFront
CloudFront routes traffic to the S3 preview bucket.

Each template is accessible at a unique route:

preview.example.com/templates/<slug>

4.3 Optional: Template Download or Clone
Users can click to "Download ZIP" (served from S3).

Or fork the template into their own workspace (if you offer that).

üîÅ 5. Automation & CI/CD Pipelines
5.1 Conversion Trigger
Event-driven Lambda triggered by form submission or S3 object creation.

5.2 Build Step
CodeBuild or container-based Lambda builds new templates.

Git-based monorepo for core Next.js app, with a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, CodePipeline).

5.3 Deployment
Final builds pushed to S3 with aws s3 sync or similar.

Cache invalidation handled via CloudFront.

üîê Cross-cutting Concerns
IAM & Permissions
Restrict Lambda functions to only access necessary S3 buckets.

Use scoped IAM roles for:

Conversion

Build

Preview deploy

Metadata access (DynamoDB)

Monitoring & Logging
CloudWatch logs on all Lambda invocations.

CloudWatch alarms on failure (template build, metadata write, preview deployment).
